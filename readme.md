# SimpleBill

This is a very simple MacOS application which I use for handling my billing with Glenview Software. This uses SQLite to store the data, and provides a very simple mechanism for creating projects which bill hourly, and adding data for tracking your time and for sending out bills.

I make no warranty of the fitness of this, and am tossing it out there in case others may have an interest.
